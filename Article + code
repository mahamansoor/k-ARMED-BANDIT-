This second chapter of the Reinforcement learning book written by Sutton et al. (2020) described how evaluative feedback and differentiates it from the instructive feedback.
Evaluative feedback where the feedback entirely depends on the action taken by the agent where as, instructive feedback where the feedback does not entirely depends on the actions
taken by the agent. Furthermore, this chapter is based on Non-associative setting where learning does not occur in more than one situation which is a simple version of K-armed
bandit problem and hence we will apply the reinforcement learning on this simple version of k-armed bandit problem.
